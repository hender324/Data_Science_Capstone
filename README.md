Repository for Data Science Training 
Below are my three Capstone project ideas for the SpringBoard Introduction to Data Science course.

Project Idea 1:
Evaluate the financial, reputation, and cultural costs of an American company expanding overseas. Five global markets are under consideration:
1.)	South Africa
2.)	London
3.)	Brazil
4.)	Saudi Arabia
5.)	Canada
Potential data sources:
•	IMF Economic Data: Global financial stability reports, regional economic reports, international financial statistics, exchange rates, directions of trade, and more.
•	Amnesty International: Human rights information, run independent of any political ideology, economic interest, or religion.
•	World Bank Open Data: Education statistics about everything from finances to service delivery indicators.
•	Google Public Data Explorer: Searchable large datasets on economic development worldwide.

Project Idea 2:
Estimate the decrease in square miles of livable United States land mass a century from year 2019 due to rising sea levels.
Potential data sources:
•	National Center for Environmental Health: Nationally funded data systems that have a relationship to environmental public health.
•	National Climatic Data Center: Quick links from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, covering everything from storm data to climate indices.
•	National Weather Service: Climate data, including past weather conditions and long-term averages, from specific observing stations around the United States.
•	National Centers for Environmental Information: Weather record published since 1927, including monthly mean values of pressure, temperature, precipitation, and station metadata notes documenting observation practices and station configurations.

Project Idea 3:
In 2029, approximately what percentage of the United States workforce will be working remotely, in contract, freelance, or in some other form of a non-traditional full, time, permanent in office position?
Potential data sources:
•	Department of Labor: Closely watched measures of employment and unemployment.
•	Employment by U.S. Census: Data that measures the state of the nation’s workforce, including employment and unemployment levels, as well as weeks and hours worked.
•	US Government Open Data
•	Bureau of Labor Statistics: U.S. government’s data collection of employment-related stats across regions, states, and local areas.
